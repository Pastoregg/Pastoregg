Pastoregg 

I´m Graduated in Public Administration from Universidade Estadual Paulista "Júlio de Mesquita Filho" (FCLAr) and Student of Systems Analysis and Development at Universidade Paulista.

Throughout my career, I had the opportunity to work in the commercial area (in terms of organizational processes in the sales sector) as well as in the area of ​​monitoring and management of financial and budget data.

Factors that led me to the end of 2020 to start my studies in CRM (salesforce) as well as my deepening in the area of ​​analysis and development of systems and data.
